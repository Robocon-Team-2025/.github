# Welcome to USM ROBOCON TEAM 2025!

We are thrilled to have you join us on our journey toward the ROBOCON 2025 competition. Our team is dedicated to advancing the fields of mechanical, electrical, and software engineering through the research and development of innovative robotics solutions. Beyond the technical work, we are also deeply involved in project management, ensuring that our efforts are well-coordinated and documented.


## Our Mission
Our primary goal is to design, build, and optimize a competitive robot that excels in the ROBOCON 2025 challenge. This involves extensive work in:
- **Mechanical Engineering**: Crafting and refining the physical structure and mechanisms of the robot.
- **Electrical Engineering**: Developing and implementing the robot's electronic systems and circuitry.
- **Software Development**: Writing the code that controls the robot, ensuring it operates with precision and efficiency.
- **Project Management**: Overseeing the entire project lifecycle, including documentation and coordination efforts.
