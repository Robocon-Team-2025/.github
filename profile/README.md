## üõ† Our Mission

Our primary goal is to design, build, and optimize a competitive robot that excels in the ROBOCON 2025 challenge. This involves extensive work in:
- **Mechanical Engineering**: Crafting and refining the physical structure and mechanisms of the robot.
- **Electrical Engineering**: Developing and implementing the robot's electronic systems and circuitry.
- **Software Development**: Writing the code that controls the robot, ensuring it operates with precision and efficiency.
- **Management Department**: Overseeing multimedia for visual content creation, inventory for resource tracking and management, outreach for community engagement and partnerships, and maintenance to ensure all equipment and systems are in optimal condition.
