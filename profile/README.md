## Our Mission
Our primary goal is to design, build, and optimize a competitive robot that excels in the ROBOCON 2025 challenge. This involves extensive work in:
- **Mechanical Engineering**: Crafting and refining the physical structure and mechanisms of the robot.
- **Electrical Engineering**: Developing and implementing the robot's electronic systems and circuitry.
- **Software Development**: Writing the code that controls the robot, ensuring it operates with precision and efficiency.
- **Management Department**: The management department encompasses multimedia for visual content creation, inventory for tracking and managing resources, outreach for community engagement and partnerships, and maintenance for ensuring all   
                             equipment and systems are in optimal condition.
